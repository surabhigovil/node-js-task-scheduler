This is a task scheduler that lets user create and delete events. I have used  dhtmlxScheduler, an embeddable JavaScript calendar to make an online task schedluer. To run the app, do the next after cloning the repo

npm install
npm start

after that, open in a browser http://localhost:3000/init to generate a test data, and http://localhost:3000 to check the calendar.
